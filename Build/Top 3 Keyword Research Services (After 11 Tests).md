## Best SEO Keyword Research Services

### 1. Loganix

Loganix stands out significantly from the rest. No disrespect to others, but it wasn't even close.

**What I loved about Loganix’s service:**

- **Detailed Instructions + Beautiful Report**

  The level of detail and design of Loganix’s report made a great first impression.

- **Prioritization of Search Intent**

  Keyword research is ineffective without understanding or categorizing keywords based on intent. Loganix excels in this area.

The total investment for their service is $149, delivering 6,615 keyword opportunities—just $0.02 per keyword.

### 2. Upwork Freelancer

I hired four “expert” freelancers on Upwork, and Jalal was the best.

While his report wasn’t as polished as Loganix’s, it still offered great value.

The project cost was $50, and Jalal found 609 opportunities, equating to $0.08 per keyword.

### 3. Fiverr Gig

I tested five services on Fiverr, and [this one](https://bit.ly/FiVErr) was outstanding.

For only $10, this service found 2,791 keywords—just $0.003 per keyword!

## How We Tested the Services

1. Found eleven services via Fiverr, Upwork, and Google.
2. Submitted the same keywords, website, and project details to each.
3. Reviewed each report and scored based on value relative to price.

## Conclusion + A Hilarious Plot Twist

You can't go wrong with any of the top three services.

Here's a twist: Two reports looked eerily similar. The Upwork freelancer outsourced the project to the exact Fiverr gig I was testing, charging me $75 for a $10 service.

Use the services or freelancers mentioned for keyword research, and you won’t be disappointed.
